<p>Source code from the April 2007 meeting of <a href="http://wiki.alu.org/lispsea">LispSea</a>:
  <b>Lisp manipulation of C structures</b></p>

<p>This includes full source code beyond what has been
<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Common_Lisp/Files_and_Directories/C_struct">contributed</a>
to <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Common_Lisp">WikiBooks</a>.</p>

<p>Much thanks to the person with deep knowledge of SBCL internals who
elaborated on the point that characters are <em>not cheap</em> in ANSI CL as
someone with a C/C++ or Perl/Python/Ruby background might assume.  There are
font and other metadata associated with them.  Also, your Lisp system of
choice may not necessarily use Unicode, iso-8859-1 or even ASCII encoding.
Additionally, some Lisp systems may choke on non-ASCII values, specifically
anything above 127.</p>
